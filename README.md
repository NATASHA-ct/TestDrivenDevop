# TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

This is a collaborated project we did when practicing application of Test Driven Development(TDD) principles in developing programs. All the classes and methods were written after the tests had been implemented.We used algorithms for factorial and fizzbuzz.

## Built With
- Ruby
- Terminal
- Rspec for testing
- Rubocop (linters)

 https://github.com/NATASHA-ct/School-Library-Database.git

-Locate the directory in your file explorer

-cd schoo-library

-Install Rubocop using...
  bundle install
  
For  Rspec you need to install the rspec gem using :
  gem install rspec
  -NB* individual tests are known in RSpec, as the ‚ÄúExamples‚Äù.
  
To run the test run in your terminal :rspec spec
